<body>
    <p>Davis St Espresso is one of the best cafes in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex. They offer amazing beans for sale, great simple esspresso drinks as well as more familiar 
        coffee drinks such as flavored lattes and iced coffees and the occasional experimental third wave coffee specialty such as espresso tonics or brewing chocolate.

    <p>Do be warned however that they do not have alternative milks, at least not the last time I checked.</p>
